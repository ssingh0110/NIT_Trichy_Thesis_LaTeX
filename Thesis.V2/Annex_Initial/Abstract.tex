Smart Grid (SG) is a paradigm where the information and communication technology fuses with the legacy electrical power grid. Bestowing a bi--directional communication interface between the consumer and the electric utility, Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), an innovative constituent of SG, bridges the gap. Thereby, consumers may respond to incentive--based schemes, such as dynamic constraint on power consumption and dynamic pricing. These parameters can be referred to as key--utility parameters, which could provide significant savings on a consumer's electricity bill for a consumption pattern.
